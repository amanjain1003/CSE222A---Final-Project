# CSE222A---Final-Project
This repository contains scripts to run experiments comparing the performance of two congestion control algorithms, Cubic and BBR, with different applications such as bulk traffic and website traffic. The scripts set up a network with a 20ms delay between client and server nodes, run the experiments, and collect data on metrics like throughput, RTT, and congestion window size. Results can be analyzed using the provided script.
